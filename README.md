# Chegg Challenge Part 2

The API Testing tool used is REST-assured .
Here is the link for more information: http://rest-assured.io/

## What is REST-assured?

REST-assured is a Java DSL for simplifying testing of REST based web services built on top of HTTP Builder. It supports POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH and HEAD requests and can be used to validate and verify the response of these requests.

## Preconditions for running the API Test

1. Java - Any version of Java should work.
2. Eclipse - Latest edition (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
3. Maven - If you are using latest version of Maven then by default Maven plugin comes with eclipse.
4. TestNG - You will need this to validate result in Rest Assured. You can follow the instructions in the given link here - https://www.toolsqa.com/testng/install-testng/ 
Note: When I installed TestNG 7.1 I had issues running the tests. So, I installed version 6.14.3(as in the above link).

## How to execute the test script and verify the result?

Test Path - ```Chegg-Part2/jsonBlobApi/src/test/java/jsonBlobApi/tests.java```
- Right click on the test 
- Run as TestNG Test

Note: Sample Screen recording of the test run has also been included. You can find it at
