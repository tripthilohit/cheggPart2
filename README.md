The API Testing tool is REST-assured .
Here is the link for more information: http://rest-assured.io/

What is REST-assured?
REST-assured is a Java DSL for simplifying testing of REST based web services built on top of HTTP Builder. It supports POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH and HEAD requests and can be used to validate and verify the response of these requests.

Preconditions for running the API Test

1. Java - Any version of Java will work. I had it pointed to Java 8
2. Eclipse - Latest edition
3. Maven - If you are using latest version of Maven then by default Maven plugin comes with eclipse.
4. TestNG - To validate result in Rest Assured 
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.rest-assured
