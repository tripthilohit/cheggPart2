Challenge 2:

Open Questions - 
1. Are there any additional tests would you add? Why?

I would add negative tests like
	- sending an incorrect content type 
	- sending an incorrect body 
API tests require both positive and negative tests to ensure that the API is working correctly.

2. Are there any common issues that we would potentially see while building or
updating similar APIs?

Some of the common issues are:
- APIs works independently but the entire flow does not work. This is very important because most of the cases the end user would be using the api requests in conjunction
with the others.

- Not adding response time assertions. Adding this will make sure the end user has a good user experience.

- Not having clear error messages. A good API error messages will  allow to quickly fix a failed call.

- No proper documentation. Many mistakes like incorrect HTTP method, body can be avoided by having a good documentation.
